# Different Approaches of Text Classification
Text classification is a popular NLP task that assigns one or more categories to a given piece of text from a larger set of possible categories. In this project, we classify texts  into 11 different categories viz.' FinTech', 'Cyber Security, 'Big Data', 'Reg Tech', 'credit reporting', 'Blockchain', 'Neobanks', 'Microservices', 'Stock Trading', 'Robo Advising', 'Data Security ‘. As vectorization techniques, I have used Bag of Words and TF-IDF. As well as simple ML classification algorithms, a few deep learning models were employed along with some pre-trained models for this text classification task. Finally, we interpreted and explained the classifier’s predictions with the Lime package.
